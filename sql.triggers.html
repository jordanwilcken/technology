What are they?

Event handlers.  You write them in whatever procedural extension is offered by the relational database program you are using.  In the case of the Oracle database that is PL/SQL.

Super Simple Example (in Oracle's PL/SQL):

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER play_sound_effect
  AFTER INSERT ON landed_punches
  FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
  punch_sound CHAR(4) = 'Pow!';
BEGIN
  dbms_output.put_line(punch_sound);
END;
/

The 'FOR EACH ROW' part causes the trigger to fire once for each row added.

When to use them:

When you need to do something that equates to handling an event.
