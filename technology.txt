***** relational subject area model *****
What? A model that shows relationships between entities that we are interested in.

When would you use it? When you are trying to understand, from a high level, how the interesting entities are related.

Example: A Quidditch team
***** relational subject area model *****

***** relational logical model *****
What? A model that shows relationships between entities that we are interested in.  The model also shows the attributes on the entities.

When would you use it? When you are getting detailed about the entities and their relationships.

Example: A Quidditch team
***** relational logical model *****

***** relational physical model *****
What? The software and hardware implementation of the data model.

Example: A Quidditch database maintained on a server farm running SQL Server.

***** SQL precision and scale - applies to exact numbers *****
Precision is the maximum number of storable digits.  Scale is the maximum number of decimal places.  Digits will always be reserved for the scale.

Example: NUMERIC(10,4) can hold up to 999,999.9999 - it cannot hold 9,999,999,999

***** implicit type conversions in SQL *****
A couple (but there are more) reasons to avoid them:
- They make your code ambiguous.
- It takes computer power to guess what your intentions are. Performance won't be as good.
***** implicit type conversions in SQL *****

***** vertical limit *****
Means limiting the data returned by specifying the columns you are interested in.
***** vertical limit *****

***** horizontal limit *****
Using a criteria to limit the rows returned, for example, returning only colors that end with "-urple".
***** horizontal limit *****

***** aliasing *****
Changing names (like a table name or column name) for understandability purposes. When aliasing columns, you use the "as" keyword.
***** aliasing *****

***** TRUNCATE *****
It's faster than DELETE and doesn't require the undo resources that DELETE does.  The downside is there is NO undo.

***** primary key *****
Should be meaningless because meaningful data changes, and we don't want the primary key to change ever.
Can be handled by computers more quickly if it's compact and numeric because that's how computers roll.
***** primary key *****

***** referential integrity *****
Is what prevents you from deleting a parent without first deleting its children. By the same token, referential integrity prevents you from adding a child without first adding its parent.
***** referential integrity *****

***** 1NF *****
Rows must be unique.  Column values can't be collections.

***** 2NF *****
Columns must be dependent on the primary key in its entirety

***** 3NF *****
All non-keys must be mutually independent.

***** scalar subquery *****
She is a subquery that returns only a single value.

Example: SELECT some_count
         FROM (SELECT COUNT(frog_desc) AS some_count from frog);
***** scalar subquery *****

***** correlated subquery *****
Is executed once for each row returned for the containing query.

Example:
		 FROM item;

***** equijoin *****
is a join where we use the '=' operator

***** natural join *****
an equijoin where columns from joined tables have the same name (so this is what it's like when doves cry)

***** views *****
are only as fast as the query that comprises them.  The view's query is executed every time you use it.  A view is not like a copy or a snapshot.  It's like a pre-build eventhandler or an rc file.

You can think of a view as reusable code.  You can also think of it as code that must be maintained.

You can use views to limit a user's access to data or to retrieve data different ways for different users.

The nice thing is that you might be able to use a view to hide complexity.
