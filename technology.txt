***** relational subject area model *****
What? A model that shows relationships between entities that we are interested in.

When would you use it? When you are trying to understand, from a high level, how the interesting entities are related.

Example: A Quidditch team
***** relational subject area model *****

***** relational logical model *****
What? A model that shows relationships between entities that we are interested in.  The model also shows the attributes on the entities.

When would you use it? When you are getting detailed about the entities and their relationships.

Example: A Quidditch team

***** relational physical model *****
What? The software and hardware implementation of the data model.

Example: A Quidditch database maintained on a server farm running SQL Server.

***** SQL precision and scale - applies to exact numbers *****
Precision is the maximum number of storable digits.  Scale is the maximum number of decimal places.  Digits will always be reserved for the scale.

Example: NUMERIC(10,4) can hold up to 999,999.9999 - it cannot hold 9,999,999,999

***** implicit type conversions in SQL *****
A couple (but there are more) reasons to avoid them:
- They make your code ambiguous.
- It takes computer power to guess what your intentions are. Performance won't be as good.
***** implicit type conversions in SQL *****

***** vertical limit *****
Means limiting the data returned by specifying the columns you are interested in.
***** vertical limit *****

***** horizontal limit *****
Using a criteria to limit the rows returned, for example, returning only colors that end with "-urple".
***** horizontal limit *****

***** aliasing *****
Changing names (like a table name or column name) for understandability purposes. When aliasing columns, you use the "as" keyword.

***** TRUNCATE *****
It's faster than DELETE and doesn't require the undo resources that DELETE does.  The downside is there is NO undo.

***** primary key *****
Should be meaningless because meaningful data changes, and we don't want the primary key to change ever.
Can be handled by computers more quickly if it's compact and numeric because that's how computers roll.

***** referential integrity *****
Is what prevents you from deleting a parent without first deleting its children. By the same token, referential integrity prevents you from adding a child without first adding its parent.

***** equijoin *****
is a join where we use the '=' operator
***** equijoin *****

***** Inner join *****
The simplest and most common inner joins are equijoins.  We are combining data from multiple tables where we can see they are related using the = operator.  For example, combining related information from a book and an author table.  We would not get any information on books without authors or autors without books.
***** Inner join *****

***** Left Outer, Right Outer, and Full joins *****
Specifying left or right constrains the order in which your columns and table names need to appear in the query.  With the Full join the order doesn't matter.  Each of these joins return the same data, but the data can be ordered differently if you're left or right.  With each of these outer joins you will get all the data from the inner join example plus books without authors and authors without books.
***** Left Outer, Right Outer, and Full joins *****

***** natural join *****
an equijoin where columns from joined tables have the same name (so this is what it's like when doves cry)
***** natural join *****

***** naming constraints *****
The schema requires a name for constraints and will generate one if you do not supply one.  It is easier to work with a constraint that you have named than one with a generated name.

***** views *****
are only as fast as the query that comprises them.  The view's query is executed every time you use it.  A view is not like a copy or a snapshot.  It's like a pre-build eventhandler or an rc file.

You can think of a view as reusable code.  You can also think of it as code that must be maintained.

You can use views to limit a user's access to data or to retrieve data different ways for different users.

The nice thing is that you might be able to use a view to hide complexity.

***** SQL vs NoSQL *****
NoSQL is supposed to be easier to scale and more friendly towards data that is not well-defined or that often changes.

NoSQL is supposed to be more object-oriented in its interface than SQL is.

According to Mongo's whitepaper, "graph databases are useful in cases where relationships are core to the application, like social networks."

The Mongo whitepaper says key-value "can be useful for representing polymorphic and unstructured data, as the database does not enforce a set schema across key-value pairs."

The Mongo whitepaper says, in essence, that "wide column stores" or "column family stores" are databases that get fancy with the columns.

The Mongo whitepaper says that since data access for key-value and wide column are so simple (querying by a single key value), they are highly optimizable and scalable.

Mongo whitepaper says the document-based approach gives you the most query power.

Some sources on the interwebs will tell you that SQL has still more query power than document-based NoSQL.

Some sources also say you get better transaction support with SQL than you do with NoSQL.

The SQL API is much older and more widely known than its NoSQL counterparts.

What is necessary for top-tier Web sites, according to proponents of NoSQL, is massive scalability, low latency, the ability to grow the capacity of your database on demand and an easier programming model.

***** MySQL *****
She is supposed to be scale-friendly.
She is open source.

***** ACID *****
Atomicity - if a transaction fails, it fails completely, and the database is the same as before the transaction was attempted.

Consistency - if a transaction is invalid it just doesn't go.

Isolation - transactions are mutually independent and must take turns if they are both trying to modify the same data.

Durability - if a transaction succeeds, it will persist.  Even if the system fails.

It seems a transaction is only a transaction if it makes it to the log.
***** ACID *****

***** CAP *****
Consistency.

Availability - whenever I make a query, the database will answer it right away.

Partition tolerance - If one node in my data system is down, some other node in the system can respond to my query.

The CAP theorum says it is impossible to guarantee all 3 at the same time.
***** CAP *****

***** consistent system *****
A system in which writes are immediately visible in subsequent queries.  Mongo has tunable consistency, defined at the query level the Mongo whitepaper says.  Mongo white paper also says that normally key-value and wide column databases are eventually consistent.
***** consistent system *****

***** Indexes *****
As in search, they make you faster. Indices on numeric columns with mostly unique values are the ideal.
***** Indexes *****

***** Clustered Index *****
In Oracle land they are called index organized tables (IOTs).  Instead of the rows being ordered as they were entered, they are stored on the disc by their index(es).

You want to use this cluster thing for columns that are more static because changing the columns means reordering the entire table.

There are other special ways to index including xml-based and function-based indexes.
***** Clustered Index *****

***** Materialized View *****
She is a view/table hybrid.  The upside is performance.  The downside is thedata can get stale (until you refresh).  Good when lots of people are after the same mostly static data.
***** Materialized View *****

***** Temporary Table *****
It's what you'd expect.  I guess you create them as snapshots of your more permanent tables.

Visibility and longevity depend on your RDBMS.

***** Optimistic and Pessimistic Concurrency *****
Optimistic assumes that resource conflicts are unlikely, and when we do have a conflict we will resubmit data giving the last commit precedence.

Pessimistic assumes we are going to have conflicts and locks resources to prevent them.

***** Angularjs service definition functions and when to use them *****
All services are singletons.

Use provider when you want configuration power to be PROVIDED.

Use factory when you don't need the configuration power.

Use service when you want Angular to create the object that will constitute the service using a constructor that you pass in.

Use value when you want to pass in an object that will constitute the service.

Use constant when you want your value to be unchangeable.
***** Angularjs service definition functions and when to use them *****

***** filters and ng-repeat *****
According to Ben Nadel, filters get executed on each call to $digest.  If your collection is small and your filter is simple, it doesn't matter.  Otherwise, you may have performance problems.  The solution is to manually filter your collections with a $watch statement.  All this according to Ben Nadel.
***** filters and ng-repeat *****

***** $apply and $digest *****
$apply calls $digest which tells the watchers to check the viewmodel.  $apply accepts an expression as an argument.  It will evaluate the expression before it calls $digest.  It wraps the expression in a try catch for you, and it calls $digest in the finally.  If you're not passing an expression to $apply, you might as well call $digest directly.  This according to Ben Lesh.

***** getting data for an angular view - when to use John Papa's controller.activate or route resolve *****
John uses route resolve when he wants the ability to cancel the route before going to the view.  The view will load right away if you use activate, but with route resolve you have to wait for the resolve to resolve before you get to the view.
***** getting data for an angular view - when to use John Papa's controller.activate or route resolve *****

***** a javascript promise - the A+ specification *****
Has a 'then' method.  The 'then' provides access to its eventual value or reason.  The 'then' method accepts two arguments an onFulfilled and an onRejected function.  It must return a promise.

A promise's 'then' method can be called multiple times, and each provided onRejected or onFulfilled function must be called in accordance with the promise's ultimate state.

Calls onFulfilled only once after the promise is fulfilled and passes in the promise's value as the first argument.

Calls onRejected only once after the promise is rejected and passes in the reason as the first argument.

Is in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

Once in the fulfilled or rejected states, it stays there.  If rejected, it has a reason that will not change.
***** a javascript promise - the A+ specification *****

***** js promises in general *****
The success or fail callbacks are always called asynchronously, which includes those times when it is not necessary.  The soonest the callbacks will be called is the next turn of the event loop.

***** px or em *****
1 em = font-size of current document (i.e. 12pt). Scales.

1 px = one dot on the computer screen.  Does not scale.

1 pt = 1 / 72 inches. Does not scale.

100% = font-size of current document. Scales.

All is when you got a bunch of promises together.
There is also a method to handle an arbitrary sequence of promises, but I forget the syntax.

Spring's RestTemplate is a class for mapping the response from a restful webservice to a Java object.

Spring's jdbc template takes care of all your relational setup for you.  You can query the data without having to worry about connections and etc.

Spring also provides an easy button for authentication using LDAP.  Other security-related features as well.

Provides a Twitter interface feature.

Provides validation and web-scraping features.

Really, just check the Spring.io guides to see all what she can do.
